- **FR-013**: No discernible layer architecture (no domain/service/adapter separation)
- **FR-014**: Low dependency injection ratio: 9%
- **FR-015**: Low traceability ratio: 0% concepts fully traced
- **FR-016**: 16 orphaned concepts (only in one source)
- **FR-017**: 18 test functions missing concept markers
- **FR-018**: 38 significant functions (>10 lines) missing concept markers in docstrings

- **FR-023**: keepachangelog not installed — pip install 'universal-skills[code-enhancer]'
- **FR-024**: 1 test files exceed 500 lines — split into focused modules
- **FR-025**: No @pytest.mark.parametrize usage — consider data-driven tests
- **FR-026**: 3 tests have no assertions
- **FR-027**: 2 tests exceed 100 lines — likely doing too much per test
